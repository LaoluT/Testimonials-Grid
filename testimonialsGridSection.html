	      	<p class="reviewParagragh">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
 									 transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
 									 for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
 									 The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
 									 the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

      	<p class="reviewParagragh"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
  									professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
 									student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
  									did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
  									project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
